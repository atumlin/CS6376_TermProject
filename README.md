# Comparative Analysis of RL and Linear Control Methods for the Inverted Pendulum Problem

## Overview
This project, by Anne M. Tumlin of Vanderbilt University, compares Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Linear Control Methods, focusing on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Q-Learning approach for solving the inverted pendulum problem.

## Dependencies
- Python
- MATLAB
- OpenAI Gym (for RL simulations)

## Usage
Run the Python notebook for the RL methods and MATLAB for LQR.

## Methodologies
Overview of RL techniques (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning) and LQR. See the project report for more details.

## Results
Compares effectiveness, reliability, and adaptability of RL and LQR in maintaining pendulum balance and safety. See the project report for more details.

## Project Report
A report detailing the findings and methods of the project can be found in the repository under CS6376_FinalProjectPaper.pdf.
